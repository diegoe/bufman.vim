Easily switch between buffers without knowing their numbers. 

The SHIFT+F1...SHIFT+F12 keys are mapped to switch to the Nth listed buffer (not buffer #N). Quite handy.

There are also other mappings to switch to the next and previous buffer and to close the current buffer.

No windows that consume precious screen-space will be created.
